    "<strong>Scanning Tunneling Microscopy</strong> (STM) stands as a revolutionary imaging technique in the domain of nanotechnology, offering exceptional resolution at the atomic and molecular levels. Pioneered in 1981 by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer [\\[1\\]](#Bibliography), recipients of the Nobel Prize, STM functions by scanning an acute metallic tip in close proximity to a sample surface. Operating on the principle of tunneling current, a quantum mechanical phenomenon, this technique enables scientists to observe and manipulate individual atoms  [\\[2\\]](#Bibliography). With diverse applications across physics, chemistry, and materials science, STM has transformed our comprehension of surface structures, electronic properties, and the intricate nanoscale universe. Serving as a non-optical method, STM has become an indispensable instrument for scrutinizing and manipulating matter with extraordinary precision, unlocking new horizons in the exploration of nanomaterials and nanodevices."

    "In scanning tunneling microscopy, piezo-elements maneuver a metal tip across the surface of a sample (see Fig 1b). Due to an applied voltage and the small distance between the tip and sample (a few ångströms), it becomes possible to measure a tunneling current.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scanning of the sample can be executed in either constant-height or constant-current mode. In constant-height mode, the tunneling current varies with the lateral position of the tip. In the more commonly used constant-current mode, a feedback loop adjusts the height of the tip to maintain a constant tunneling current. Consequently, this yields a profile of the height based on the z-signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remarkable resolution down to the atomic level is facilitated by the exponential dependence of the tunneling current on the distance (a change in distance by one ångström results in a tunneling current change of one order of magnitude) and the precise movement with the piezo-elements. Piezo-elements undergo shape changes under applied voltage. Altering the voltage allows for moving the tip with picometer precision.\""
